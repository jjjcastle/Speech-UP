I will also check the restaurant's interiors, typical crowd levels, and if they take reservations because I do not want to wait in line on dates. However, if I am eating alone in a hurry or having a casual dining situation with close friends, I will choose a place with a more relaxed atmosphere, affordable prices, and generous portions. Currently, I am living in New York where everything is expensive, so I usually opt for Chinese restaurants in the Lower Manhattan area because they are generally good and affordable."}

Of course, I am really happy when I eat delicious food, but it's the worst to feel hungry while waiting in line. It brings me joy to stumble upon a restaurant I want to eat at and enjoy a meal at a delicious restaurant I found by chance.

{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. But plans are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced a green new deal policy and announced that it would implement a low carbon. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy, not fossil fuels or alternative energy. Global fuels are limited and will run out, and global warming is accelerating. For future generations, we should be working on alternative energy development from now on.", "target": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels.

So, I often cannot sit at my seat. So, I have to spend for a long time in buses or as always. And I think that's one of the disadvantages I can think of the public transportation.

Firstly, in terms of advantages, I find that it is cost-effective. I can travel to distant locations at a low cost, as expenses are not high. If I were to use my own car for long-distance trips, I would incur significant expenses for gasoline and maintenance. However, with public transportation, I can reach these places without spending as much. On the other hand, one disadvantage is the occasional discomfort when using public transportation. The vehicles can be crowded, making it difficult to find a seat. As a result, I often have to stand for extended periods on buses or trains. This inconvenience is a notable drawback of public transportation. Nevertheless, the overall cost savings make it a favorable option for me."}

{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. Plans are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced the Green New Deal and announced that it would implement a low carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Second, because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy. Not fossil fuels or alternative energy. Fossil fuels are limited and will run out, and global warming is accelerating. For future generations, we should be working on alternative energy development from now on.", "target": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels.

Because vaccination is a matter of urgency, employers need to force their employees to get vaccinated for work. One might think that this is an excessive repression of freedom.

First, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. But plans are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea also recently announced the Green New Deal and announced that it would implement a low carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Secondly, because the future will be rich, when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy, not fossil fuels or alternative energy. fossil fuels are limited and will run out, and global warming is accelerating.

Secondly, the future will necessitate a shift towards alternative energy as fossil fuels are depleted and environmental issues need to be addressed. With global warming and climate change becoming increasingly severe, future generations will bear the brunt of these challenges. Therefore, I anticipate an era where alternative energy will be the primary source of energy, replacing both fossil fuels and alternative energy sources. Fossil fuels are finite and will eventually be depleted, while global warming continues to escalate. It is imperative that we prioritize the development of alternative energy sources for the benefit of future generations."}

Furthermore, vaccination directly relates to other people's health issue. I believe someone's freedom cannot limit someone else's safety.

More offer, people's interests and environments are also growing so fast, so there will be a lot of attempts and researches on how to reduce the carbon dioxide level for the earth. Fossil fuels are definitely one of the major reasons that emit carbon dioxide, so it is obvious and just a matter of time how fast will replace that to which energy. Lastly, we eventually will be running out of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are a limited energy, and since the alternative energy is more sustainable, in the future at some point they will be ran out which makes them so inefficient compared to the alternative energy.

{"input": "This graph is comparing Japan and the United States on the car charging points and gas station numbers. So the green bar is the electric vehicle charging stations and the blue bar is the number of gas stations. So the green bar is for electric vehicles or EVs in short. And the blue graph is for cars that use gas or in other words the conventional cars with internal combustion engines. So by 2016 the number of charging stations for EVs is going to outnumber the gas stations in Japan. This graph implies that electric vehicles in Japan are going to outnumber the conventional cars with engines that use gas. On the other hand the United States and the United States there are 114,500 gas stations as opposed to only 9,000 electric vehicle charging stations. So we are not looking at sufficient transition towards electric vehicles when it comes to America. The slow transition from engine cars to EVs in the United States might be largely due to the lack of infrastructure. In other words the charging stations because when people buy electric vehicles in the United States they are going to have trouble using that car. Comfortably or conveniently because there are not enough stations around America. This is kind of funny because Japan is much smaller in size of the territory as opposed to America. But they outnumber but the charging stations buy almost three times.", "target": "This graph compares Japan and the United States in terms of car charging points and gas station numbers.

This suggests that electric vehicles in Japan will outnumber conventional gas-powered cars. In contrast, the United States has 114,500 gas stations compared to only 9,000 electric vehicle charging stations, indicating a slower transition towards electric vehicles in America. This slow transition may be largely attributed to the lack of infrastructure, specifically the insufficient number of charging stations. This poses challenges for electric vehicle owners in the United States, as they may face inconvenience due to the limited availability of charging stations across the country. It is interesting to note that despite Japan's smaller size compared to America, they have almost three times the number of charging stations."}

{"input": "One of the advantages of public transportation is that we can decrease traffic congestion. If more people use public transportation, there would be less cars on the road. Another positive aspect of public transportation is that we can reduce greenhouse gases and the amount of carbon emission. According to a survey, if we use public transportation just one day in a week, we can reduce 445 kilograms of carbon dioxide annually. Not only that, using public transportation is cheaper than driving our own cars. We would need extra expenditure when we drive our own cars, such as maintenance expenses and gas price. On the contrary, riding a survey only costs about 1,251, and bus fare only costs about 1,401,000. However, the disadvantages of public transportation do exist as well. First, it is quite stressful to take a crowded bus or subway, especially at commuting times when many people gather up to ride buses and subways. For example, we cannot easily rest in subways packed with so many people. Also, we may have to endure extreme heat caused by crowds of people. Another inconvenience of public transportation is that it is sometimes hard to adjust to the bus or subway operating intervals. For instance, if we have to ride a bus that does not run often, we may have to wait for that bus for a long time.

The higher the percentage, the more amount of money the certain service brought an income. To list the categories in order of the percentage, haircut and styling service comes first, hair color service follows next, then comes the retail sales, and care services comes last.

The ratio of the section that recorded the highest percentage which was haircut and styling service was more than 8 times that of the section that recorded the lowest percentage which was care services. Even though we add all the proportions of the service except haircut and styling service, they cannot exceed that of the haircut and styling service. Therefore, it can be said that the main source of income of the average hairdresser in the United States of America is biased to haircut and styling service. Nonetheless, we cannot know for sure if the fact that the percentage of the haircut and styling service was the highest was because the cost of this service was the highest, or because the number of the customers who used this service was the greatest. Regardless of its cost.", "target": "The data and the provided pie chart show how average hair salons in the United States generate revenue. According to the chart, US hairdressers typically earn money through four different sources of income: care services, retail sales, hair color services, and haircut and styling services. The higher the percentage, the more income a certain service brought in. To list the categories in order of percentage, haircut and styling services come first, followed by hair color services, then retail sales, and finally care services. Haircut and styling services, which accounted for the highest percentage, made up 62% of the total income of an average beauty salon in the US. Hair color services accounted for 23% of the total revenue earned by a typical American beauty shop, almost a quarter of the income. Retail sales contributed 8% of the income of the average beautician in the United States, while care services brought in the remaining 7% of revenue. The difference between the percentage of the service that brought in the least income and the service that brought in the second least income was only 1%. The revenue from hair color services was more than three times that of care services. The difference between the section with the largest portion and the section with the smallest portion was over 50%. The ratio of the section with the highest percentage, haircut and styling services, was more than 8 times that of the section with the lowest percentage, care services. Even when adding all the proportions of the services except haircut and styling services, they could not surpass that of haircut and styling services. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary source of income for the average hairdresser in the United States is biased towards haircut and styling services. However, it is uncertain whether the high percentage of haircut and styling services is due to their high cost or the large number of customers using this service."}

And I don't have time to go to the big supermarket. I usually buy my groceries online, but nowadays the delivery fee is getting too expensive, so it would be great if I can go to a huge shopping mall right near my house and buy my groceries. I can visit the shopping mall on my way home from work, which would be extremely convenient for me. Second, by having a big shopping mall near my house, I don't have to go far to eat. Eat out or go to a cafe. In Korea, big shopping malls mostly come with a variety of restaurants and cafes, as well as cultural centers and entertainment facilities, such as concert halls, galleries, bookstores, and movie theaters. I even saw we are gaming centers and exotic aqua cafes or planetarium cafes. In the big shopping malls, I recently visited.

{"input": "I think employers should get their employees vaccinated. COVID-19 began in the second half of 2019, and many industries have shrunk. The world's economy has been devastated and is still in progress. Currently, vaccinations are mandatory in many countries, and most people have been vaccinated. Of course, there are many people who express negative reactions to vaccination, saying that there may be side effects. But vaccination is the most effective way to get hurt in unity, to turn our lives around. Because vaccination is a matter of urgency, employers need to force their employees to get vaccinated for work. One might think that this is an excessive repression of freedom. But if you are not someone who's had a big side effect from vaccination, I think you should be obligated to vaccinate based on the overall atmosphere of the society.", "target": "I believe employers should ensure that their employees are vaccinated. COVID-19 originated in the second half of 2019, leading to significant contractions in many industries. The global economy has been severely impacted and is still recovering. Currently, vaccinations are mandatory in numerous countries, with a majority of the population already vaccinated. While some individuals express concerns about potential side effects of vaccination, it remains the most effective way to achieve herd immunity and restore normalcy to our lives. Given the urgency of vaccination, employers should require their employees to be vaccinated for the sake of workplace safety. Some may view this as an infringement on personal freedom, but in light of the prevailing societal norms, I believe individuals without significant adverse reactions to vaccination should be obligated to get vaccinated."}
{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. But plants are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced that the Green New Deal announced that it would implement a low carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Second, because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now and future generations will be directly affected. So, I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy, not the options of fossil fuels or alternative energy. Fossil fuels are limited and will run out and global warming is accelerating. For the future generations, we should be working on alternative energy development from now on.", "target": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, many countries are developing various technologies for alternative energy generation. It is true that alternative energy has not yet fully replaced fossil fuels, but efforts are being made to gradually transition to alternative energy sources, particularly in many European countries. Korea recently announced the Green New Deal, which includes implementing a low-carbon policy. Given the global trend of heightened awareness of environmental issues, I believe that more technological advancements will be made in alignment with this trend. Secondly, the future will necessitate a shift away from fossil fuels as they become depleted and environmental problems require solutions. With global warming and climate change becoming increasingly severe, future generations will bear the direct consequences. Therefore, I anticipate a future era where alternative energy becomes the primary energy source, replacing both fossil fuels and alternative energy options. Fossil fuels are finite and will eventually be depleted, while global warming continues to accelerate. It is imperative that we focus on developing alternative energy solutions for the benefit of future generations."}

{"input": "Some people say that tourism is beneficial to the environment because locals improve the environment to attract tourists. I do not agree with the statement for the following reasons. First of all, solid waste and littering is a big problem. In areas with high concentrations of tourist activities and appealing natural attractions, waste disposal is a serious problem. And improper disposal can be a major spoiler of the natural environment, rivers and row sites as well. For example, cruise ships in the Caribbean are estimated to produce more than 70,000 tons of waste every year. These kinds of solid waste and littering can degrade the physical appearance of the water and cause the death of marine animals. In addition to that, in mountain areas, trekking tourists generate a great deal of waste. Tourists on expedition leave behind your garbage, oxygen silencers and even camping equipment. Next problem is sewage, construction of hotels and other facilities can often lead to increased sewage pollution. Sewage runoff causes serious damage to coral reefs because it contains lots of nutrients and it stimulates the growth of algae, which covered a filter feeding corals, hindering their ability to survive. These kinds of sewage pollutions can threaten the health of humans and animals. For these reasons, I disagree with the fact that tourism is beneficial to the environment.", "target": "Some people argue that tourism benefits the environment because locals enhance the environment to attract tourists. However, I disagree with this statement for several reasons. Firstly, solid waste and littering pose significant challenges. In regions with high tourist activity and attractive natural features, waste management becomes a pressing issue. Improper disposal can severely impact the natural environment, including rivers and coastal areas. For instance, cruise ships in the Caribbean are estimated to generate over 70,000 tons of waste annually. Such waste and littering can mar the visual appeal of water bodies and harm marine life. Moreover, in mountainous regions, trekking tourists often leave behind a substantial amount of waste, including garbage, oxygen canisters, and camping gear. Another concern is sewage pollution; the construction of hotels and other amenities can contribute to increased sewage discharge. Sewage runoff can cause significant harm to coral reefs by introducing excess nutrients that promote algae growth, which can smother filter-feeding corals and impede their survival. Such sewage pollution poses risks to both human and animal health. Therefore, I do not believe that tourism is beneficial to the environment."}

Of course, there are many people who express negative reactions to vaccination, saying that there may be side effects.

Because vaccination is a matter of urgency, employers need to force their employees to get vaccinated for work. One might think that this is a excessive repression of freedom.

{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First of all, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. Our plans are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels, mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced the Green New Deal and announced that it would implement a low carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Second, because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy, not fossil fuels or alternative energy. fossil fuels are limited and will run out, and global warming is accelerating.

Secondly, the future will necessitate a shift away from fossil fuels as they become depleted and environmental problems require solutions. With global warming and climate change becoming increasingly severe, future generations will bear the brunt of these challenges. Therefore, I anticipate an era where alternative energy will be the primary source of energy, as fossil fuels are finite and depleting, while global warming continues to escalate. It is imperative that we focus on developing alternative energy solutions for the benefit of future generations."}

Of course, there are many people who express negative reactions to vaccination, saying that there may be side effects.

Because vaccination is the matter of urgency, employers need to force their employees to get vaccinated for their work. One might think that this is a excessive profession of freedom.

{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. But plans are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels, mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced a green new deal and announced that it would implement a low carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Second, because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So, I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy, not fossil fuels or alternative energy. Fossil fuels are limited and will run out, and global warming is accelerating. For future generations, we should be working on alternative energy development from now on.", "target": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First, many countries are developing technologies for alternative energy generation. While it is true that alternative energy has not yet replaced fossil fuels, plans are being made to gradually replace them, particularly in many European countries. Korea recently announced a green new deal and stated its intention to implement a low-carbon policy. Given the global trend of heightened awareness of environmental issues, I believe that more technological advances will be made in alignment with this trend. Second, the future will necessitate a shift away from fossil fuels as they are depleted and environmental problems must be addressed. With global warming and climate change becoming increasingly severe, future generations will be directly impacted. Therefore, I anticipate an era where only alternative energy, not fossil fuels, will be utilized. Fossil fuels are finite and will eventually be depleted, while global warming continues to accelerate. It is imperative that we focus on developing alternative energy solutions for the benefit of future generations."}

{"input": "I agree with the following sentence that alternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels for several reasons. First of all, the alternative energy market is growing substantially nowadays. For example, with the cars, electronic car market is growing so fast and now we can see charging systems everywhere, especially in the US and also in Korea. Take an example of how fast the company Tesla, the car company which produces electronic car is growing. Moreover, people's interests and environments are also growing so fast, so there will be a lot of attempts and researches on how to reduce the carbon dioxide level for the earth. Fossil fuels are definitely one of the major reasons that emit carbon dioxide, so it is obvious in just a matter of time how fast it will be replaced to which energy. Lastly, we eventually will be running out of fossil fuels because fossil fuels are limited energy. In the future, at some points, they will be ran out which makes them so inefficient.

{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has yet to replace fossil fuels. But plants are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels, mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced the Green New Deal and announced that it would implement a low-carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Second, because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So, I think there will be an era when we can only use alternative energy, not fossil fuels or alternative energy. Fossil fuels are limited and will run out, and global warming is accelerating. For future generations, we should be working on alternative energy development from now on.", "target": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels.

Of course, vaccines are an extreme and it's a very good efficient solution to prevent this brad of infectious disease, but the risks of vaccines themselves should not be overlooked.", "target": "I did not agree with the vaccine mandates because the side effects of vaccines can be serious depending on the individual. Since the onset of COVID-19, most people have been vaccinated multiple times, especially in Korea. However, many individuals have experienced side effects following vaccination. These side effects can range from mild symptoms like a cold or muscle pain to more severe cases that can be life-threatening. Some individuals continue to experience side effects even now. Therefore, I believe that mandatory vaccination policies are too risky. While vaccines are an effective solution to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the potential risks associated with vaccines should not be ignored."}

If it's a date, then I will choose somewhere that has good reviews. I will also check the interiors of the restaurants, such as how crowded it usually is and if they take reservations. However, if I am eating alone in a hurry or having a casual dining experience with close friends, then I'll opt for somewhere that offers more relaxed dining with affordable prices and generous portions. I currently live in New York where everything is expensive, so I usually choose Chinese restaurants in the Lower Manhattan area because they are generally good and affordable."}

Since fossil fuels are definitely one of the major reasons that amade carbon dioxide, it is obvious in like just the matter of time how fast we will replace that to which energy. Lastly we eventually will be running out of fossil fuels because fossil fuels are a limited energy. So in the future at some point they will be ran out which makes them so inefficient.

{"input": "As interest in alternative energy increases, many people say that alternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels. However, I don't agree with the idea that alternative energy can replace fossil fuels. It is a natural fact that fossil fuels harmed the environment. But fossil fuels are already being used in too many places. Currently, the speed in which alternative energy is developed is not fast enough to completely replace fossil fuels in the near future. Therefore, it is nonsense to close fossil fuel power generation facilities right now and replace them with alternative energy. Of course, it would be great if one day alternative energy replaced fossil fuels. However, it is possible to extract that alternative energy can replace some of the energy currently used, but it will be difficult for alternative energy to completely replace fossil fuels. There are two main reasons for this. It's profitability and environmental constraints. Alternative energy is low energy density and it is very expensive. Only developed countries will be able to afford this cost. There are also environmental constraints, for example, in the case of hydro power, it can destroy the marine ecosystem in the process of power generation.", "target": "As interest in alternative energy increases, many people argue that alternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels.

At present, the rate at which alternative energy is being developed is not rapid enough to entirely replace fossil fuels in the near future. Therefore, it is unreasonable to shut down fossil fuel power generation facilities immediately and substitute them with alternative energy sources. While it would be ideal for alternative energy to eventually supplant fossil fuels, it is more realistic to consider that alternative energy may only partially replace the energy currently derived from fossil fuels. There are two primary reasons for this: profitability and environmental limitations. Alternative energy sources typically have low energy density and are costly.

Of course, there are many people who express negative reactions to vaccination, saying that there may be side effects. But vaccination is the most effective way to get hard immunity to turn our lives around. Because vaccination is a matter of urgency, employers need to force their employees to get vaccinated for work. One might think that this is an excessive repression of freedom. But if you're not someone who's had a big side effects from vaccination, I think you should be obligated to vaccinate based on your overall atmosphere of society.", "target": "I believe employers should ensure that their employees are vaccinated. COVID-19 originated in the second half of 2019, leading to significant contractions in many industries. The severe economic downturn caused by the pandemic is ongoing. Currently, vaccination mandates are in place in numerous countries, with a majority of the population already vaccinated. While some individuals express concerns about potential side effects of vaccination, it remains the most effective method to achieve herd immunity and restore normalcy to our lives. Given the urgency of vaccination, employers should require their employees to be vaccinated for the sake of public health. Some may view this as an infringement on personal freedom, but if one has not experienced serious side effects from vaccination, I believe it is important to prioritize vaccination for the greater good of society."}

{"input": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels. There are two reasons for this. First, many countries are developing many technologies for alternative energy generation. Of course, it is true that alternative energy has begun to replace fossil fuels, but plants are being made to gradually replace fossil fuels, mainly in many countries in Europe. Korea recently announced the Green New Deal and announced that it would implement a low carbon policy. Since there is a global trend of being alert to environmental issues, I think more technological advances will be made in line with it. Second, because the future will be reached when fossil fuels are depleted and environmental problems must be solved. Global warming and climate change are getting serious now, and future generations will be directly affected. So I think there will be an error when we can only use alternative energy, not fossil fuels or alternative energy. Fossil fuels are eliminated and will run out, and global warming is accelerating. For future generation, we should be working on alternative energy development from now", "target": "I agree with the argument that alternative energy will effectively replace fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels are inefficient, unsustainable, environmentally destructive, and a primer contributor to global climate change. Global energy will replace fossil fuels because they will be less expensive, as reliable, and as convenient as fossil fuels. Take wind energy, for example. Wind energy has a lot of advantages. First, wind energy provides many jobs that pay well. There are a huge number of people working in the US wind industry, and that number continues to grow according to the US Bureau of Reliability Statistics. Supporting wind power will create many jobs for them. Second, wind power is a clean and renewable energy source. Wind turbines use energy from the wind and create electricity. Wind is such plantable source and is also inexhaustible. It creates electricity without polluting the air. Once it's inexhaustible, it helps us less rely on fossil fuels. Lastly, wind power produces good results without costing a lot of money. It is one of the lowest price energy sources available today.

That means it's no wonder that we were able to replace everything to the electric city instead of fossil fuels. That is giving a hope to other industry sectors as well.

We would all agree that fossil fuels are definitely one of the strong reasons that I made the carbon dioxide, so it is obvious in just a matter of time how fast will replace that to which energy. Lastly, we eventually will be running out of fossil fuels since they are limited energy. In the future, at some point, they will be ran out, which makes them so inefficient and unsustainable. As efficiency should include not just the convenience of using it, but should also include the long-term plan. I believe alternative energy can effectively replace the fossil fuels with its stability, sustainability, and it should be.", "target": "I agree with the following statement that alternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels for several reasons. Firstly, the alternative energy market is growing substantially nowadays. Even in the car industry, electric cars are growing rapidly, and we can now see charging systems everywhere, especially in the United States and Korea. This indicates that it is not surprising that we are able to replace everything with electric power instead of fossil fuels. This gives hope to other industry sectors as well. Furthermore, people's interest in the environment is also growing rapidly, leading to numerous attempts and research on how to reduce carbon dioxide levels for the Earth. We can all agree that fossil fuels are a significant contributor to carbon dioxide emissions, so it is evident that the transition to alternative energy will happen quickly. Lastly, we will eventually run out of fossil fuels as they are a finite resource. In the future, they will be depleted, making them inefficient and unsustainable. Efficiency should not only consider the convenience of use but also incorporate long-term planning. I believe that alternative energy can effectively replace fossil fuels due to its stability, sustainability, and necessity."}

It is easily reachable from anywhere in the city. When my girlfriend and I have nowhere else to go, we simply head to one of the Han River parks nearby. There, we can enjoy a meal, take a leisurely walk, engage in some exercise, or even have a romantic time in a secluded spot. If you catch my drift.

Compared to 37.1% of the responses in 2018, the response rate exceeding the majority in 2020 and 2021, this considered a shocking change. It wasn't hard to come up with the cause of change. I think COVID-19, which hit the world in 2020, is the cause.

The following year, in 2021, 51.9% of respondents echoed this sentiment. This drastic change, surpassing the 37.1% response rate from 2018, is indeed noteworthy. The primary reason for this change seems evident. I believe that the global impact of COVID-19, which emerged in 2020, played a crucial role. Concerns about potential infection risks from contact with relatives post-COVID-19 likely influenced individuals' decisions not to return home for Chuseok, leading to the significant surge in response rates from 2020 onwards."}

Compared with 37.1% of the response in 2018, the response rate exceeding the majority in 2020 and 2021 is considered to consider a shocking change. It wasn't hard to come up with the cause of the change.

Let's examine the data starting from 2018. In that year, 37.1% of the respondents stated they would not return home for Chuseok. The following year, the figure increased slightly, with 39.7% of respondents expressing the same sentiment. However, starting from 2020, a significant shift is evident in the graph pattern. In 2020, a striking 57.7% of respondents declared they would not be visiting their hometowns for Chuseok, marking the highest response rate. In 2021, the trend continued, with 51.9% of respondents opting not to travel to their hometowns. The substantial increase in response rates in 2020 and 2021, compared to the 37.1% recorded in 2018, is considered a remarkable change. The likely cause of this shift is attributed to the impact of COVID-19, which gripped the world in 2020. Concerns about infection risks from contact with relatives post-COVID-19 likely influenced individuals' decisions not to return home, leading to the notable surge in response rates from 2020 onwards."}

Compared with 37.1% of the respondents in 2018, the respondents rate exceeding the majority in 2020 and 2021 is considered a shocking change. But it wasn't hard to come up with the cause of the change. I think COVID-19, which at the world in 2020, is the cause. And I think people who were worried about infection through contact with relatives after COVID-19 responded that they would not go home on Chuseok, which is the cause of the explosive response rate from 2020.", "target": "This graph depicts the percentage of Korean office workers who indicated that they would not be going home for Chuseok. Let's examine the data starting from 2018. In 2018, 37.1% of the respondents stated that they would not be going home for Chuseok. The following year, in 2019, the rate saw a slight increase, with 39.7% of respondents expressing the same sentiment. However, there was a significant shift in the pattern of the graph in 2020, with a notable increase to 57.7% of respondents stating they would not be going home for Chuseok. This marked the highest response rate recorded. Moving on to 2021, 51.9% of respondents reported that they would not be returning to their hometowns. The substantial increase in response rates in 2020 and 2021, compared to the 37.1% recorded in 2018, is considered a striking change. The cause of this change was not difficult to identify. It is believed that the impact of COVID-19, which swept the world in 2020, was the primary factor. It is likely that individuals who were concerned about the risk of infection from contact with relatives following the pandemic chose not to travel home for Chuseok, leading to the significant surge in response rates from 2020."}

People that are in prison may be in prison for various reasons. Some people may be there simply because they couldn't afford to pay a fine. Other people may be in prison for serious criminal activities such as homicide. The person may have done something morally wrong, but it doesn't mean that we can strip them off of their basic human rights. And once again, the right to vote is a basic human right.

Individuals in prison may have ended up there for various reasons, ranging from inability to pay fines to serious criminal offenses like homicide. While a person may have committed a moral wrong, it does not justify depriving them of their basic human rights, including the right to vote. Access to all election-related information should also be provided to incarcerated individuals so they can make informed decisions when casting their votes.

But I think nothing is unpolitical. Everything is political because if you want to change something that you don't like, it has to be done through politics. So I think this is also a political problem because all members of a society should be able to have a right to vote. And taking away that right, just because of something they have done in the past will be very dangerous because that reason can be used otherwise if they are used to take away some bodies. And the reason why those people are in prison is because it is to exclude them from our society because they have violated some other people's rights so they cannot violate other people's rights once again. And that does not make them take away their right to be a member of a society.

Therefore, I view the issue of voting rights for prisoners as a political matter, as all members of society should have this fundamental right. Denying this right based on past actions could set a dangerous precedent, as such reasoning could be used to disenfranchise others. While individuals are in prison as a form of societal exclusion due to their violation of others' rights, this should not automatically strip them of their right to participate in society through voting.

Their actions, such as harming others or influencing negatively, demonstrate their inability to make responsible choices.

So I think this is also a political problem because all members of a society should be able to have a right to vote. And taking away that right just because of something they have done in the past will be very dangerous because that reason can be used otherwise if they are used to take away some bodies. And the reason why those people are in prison is because it is to exclude them from our society because they have violated some other people's rights so they cannot violate other people's rights once again.

Therefore, I view the issue of voting rights for prisoners as a political matter, as all members of society should have the right to vote. Denying this right based on past actions could set a dangerous precedent, as such reasoning could be used to disenfranchise others. The purpose of imprisoning individuals is to exclude them from society due to their violation of others' rights, not to strip them of their membership in society.

Italy had 2.78 million visitors, and Spain had approximately 2.5-3 million visitors in 2018. The United States is not closely related to the United Kingdom in terms of religion. Therefore, despite the significant number of visitors, it may be attributed to Britain's own traditions. The historical ties between the United States and the United Kingdom, spanning over 200 years, may explain the high number of American visitors. France attracts a large number of visitors due to its central location. The cultural and religious exchanges between Britain and France also contribute to this trend. It is surprising that Spain in the South also receives a relatively high number of visitors. Spain's appeal to visitors may be linked to its unique traditions, which attract tourists. In conclusion, the United States had the highest number of visitors to the United Kingdom in 2018, followed by Germany and France."}
